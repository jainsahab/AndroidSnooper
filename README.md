## Introduction
Android Snooper is a HTTP inspector which observes all the HTTP calls made by the app and opens up an Activity to see the detailed history of HTTP calls on `onShake` event. This library is inspired by the `Network Request History` feature of [FLEX](https://github.com/Flipboard/FLEX) app for iOS.

Android Snooper works on the interceptor mechanism provided by almost every HTTP client. All you need to do is initialize Android Snooper using `AndroidSnooper.init(this);` statement in your Application class and set an instance of `SnooperInterceptor` to the list of your network interceptors.
As of now we are providing the interceptors for the below libraries.

* [Spring Android Rest Template](http://projects.spring.io/spring-android/)
* [Square's OkHttp Client](https://github.com/square/okhttp)

Didn't get your HTTP client's name in the list? No worries, You can still write your own implementation by using `Android Snooper's` core module and let Android Snooper know about the request being made. Below is given a dummy implementation.
```java
    AndroidSnooper androidSnooper = AndroidSnooper.getInstance();
    HttpCall httpCall = new HttpCall.Builder()
      .withUrl(httpRequest.getUrl())
      .withPayload(httpRequest.getRequestPayload())
      .withMethod(httpRequest.getMethod())
      .withResponseBody(httpResponse.getResponseBody())
      .withStatusCode(httpResponse.getRawStatusCode())
      .withStatusText(httpResponse.getStatusCode())
      .withRequestHeaders(httpRequest.getHeaders())
      .withResponseHeaders(httpResponse.getHeaders())
      .build();
    androidSnooper.record(httpCall);
```
The above implementation ought to be part of your custom interceptor where you will have access to the required `Request` and `Response` object to jot down the required data for Android Snooper to work properly.

**Warning:** As Android Snooper records each and every HTTP call goes through it. Please be cautious as it will record the sensitive information such as **Auth Tokens**, **Headers** etc. The only purpose of this library is *Debugging*. Hence, Debug or QA builds are the **only** perfect candidate for this library.

## Installation
```groovy
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    // when using Android Snooper's core module
    compile ('com.github.jainsahab:Snooper:1.0.2@aar'){
      transitive = true
    }

    // Android Snooper library for "Spring Android Rest Template"
    compile ('com.github.jainsahab:Snooper-Spring:1.0.2@aar'){
      transitive = true
    }
    
    // Android Snooper library for "Square's Okhttp"
    compile ('com.github.jainsahab:Snooper-Okhttp:1.0.2@aar'){
      transitive = true
    }
```
Snapshot versions are available in [Sonatype's snapshots repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots).
